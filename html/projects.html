            <h3>Schedule-set</h3>
            <p>
                Schedule-set was a development project I took part in with several students of The Tech Academy. The project 
                simulated the work-flow of a team development project. We utilized Entity Framework code-first database modeling, and
                the DotNet MVC Framework to create a web appplication that can handle the Employee and Managerial scheduling needs of a business. 
                My contributions in this project ranged from creating views, writing server-side controller script, 
                manipulating views with Javascript, and database modeling.

            <h3>The Tech Academy</h3>
            <p>
                In the Tech Academy I worked with a range of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and the DotNet Framework. 
                But most importantly, the skills of problem solving and self-education were impressed upon me. I was trained in discerning 
                problems and finding solutions, a skill that translates into any technology. In addition to these core assets, I gained invaluable 
                experience in C# and the DotNet Framework, and how these technologies interact with modern Javascript concepts like Knockout.js and Ajax.

            <h3>Previous Experience</h3>
            <p>
                I come from the experiential marketing industry where my primary role was graphic film installation.
                I helped build retail displays, exhibitions, and events for major athletic wear companies.
                We brought their designs to life with the limited time and resources their environments afforded. In this industry,
                details and solutions are all that mattered. Theres no such thing as not enough time and "Sorry, we cant do that" is never
                an acceptable answer. We were the liason between design and reality, setting realistic expectations at the begining of the project
                and performing minor miracles hours before impending deadlines.
