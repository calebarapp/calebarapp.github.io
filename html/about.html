            <p>My name Caleb Rapp, and I am a front-end web developer with a focus on implementation of quality design.  My work in the experiential marketing industry 
                has taught me to appreciate the components as much as the sum, because they are often what define the experience.</p>

                <h3>Experience</h3>
            <div class = "x-container">
                    <div class = "x-container__1"> </div>
                    <div class = "x-container__2"> </div>
                </div>
            <p>I come from the experiential marketing industry where my primary role was graphic film installation.
            I helped build retail displays, exhibitions, and events for major athletic wear companies.
            We brought their designs to life with the limited time and resources their environments afforded. In this industry,
            details and solutions are all that mattered. Theres no such thing as not enough time and "Sorry, we cant do that" is never 
            an acceptable answer. We were the liason between design and reality, setting realistic expectations at the begining of the project
            and performing minor miracles minutes before impending deadlines. 
        </p>

                <h3>More about me</h3>
            <div class = "x-container">
                    <div class = "x-container__1"> </div>
                    <div class = "x-container__2"> </div>
                </div>
            <p>For me, work life balance means taking every opportunity to enjoy
            all that living in the Northwest has to offer. Snowboarding, road trips
            to the coast, or scouting out the newest vegan restaurants are regulars on my
            to-do list. Creating has always been a passion of mine. The first outlet
            I discovered for this was music. So if I'm not behind my laptop, youâ€™ll
            probably find me behind my guitar. </p>
