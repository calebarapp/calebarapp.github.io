                I am Caleb Rapp, a web developer from Portland, Oregon. I work primarily with the DotNet
                stack, and I take particular interest in front-end development. Building dynamic interfaces is a process that
                I have found to be very rewarding. Working with JavaScript and it's quirks presents many unique challenges
                and oppertunities to develop creative solutions.
                My inate curiosity has always driven me to find out exactly how things work, rather than simply accept that they work.
                I like to experiment and to explore. This has certainly played a part in what has driven my lifelong interest in technology.
                <br />
                <br />
                Consciousness and sustainablility are held as guiding principles in my life. Technology has served to 
                advance these ends considerably in the last few decades. I believe creating a more inter-connected world will be vital 
                in creating a more sustianable world. Tech offers the chance for me to play a part in shaping a more equitable future
                and building tools that facilitate greener solutions in both the business world and our personal lives. 
                <br />
                <br />
                Outside of tech, I am an avid fan of history and music. Music was the first outlet for my analitical and creative
                side, and it has been a constant in my life. So if I'm not coding, you will probably find me behind my guitar. My family is located 
                in the heart of Portland in the alphabet blocks. On our off time we like to take in as much of the culinary and artistic character of 
                the city as we can. Alternatively, if it's winter we are likely somewhere in the mountains.
