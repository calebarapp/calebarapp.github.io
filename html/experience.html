            <h3>Projects</h3>
            <p>I have been working with mostly with React and .Net core in recent months. 
                My current project is Tabber, a web application for transcribing guitar tabulature in ASCII Tab format.
                It's still in its early stages but I'm pretty excited to see where it goes.

            <h3>Propser I.T. Consulting</h3>
            <p>
                 At my internship with Prosper I.T. Consulting I contributed to the development of a schedule management application. 
                 In this role I worked with every aspect of the .Net stack, from creating views, to server-side scripting, and modeling a database.
                 Outside of this development project, I created introductory courses on Selenium and React for the company's educational services.

            <h3>The Tech Academy</h3>
            <p>
                In the Tech Academy I worked with a range of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and the DotNet Framework. 
                But most importantly, the skills of problem solving and self-education were impressed upon me. I was trained in discerning 
                problems and finding solutions, a skill that translates into any technology. In addition to these core assets, I gained invaluable 
                experience in C# and the DotNet Framework.

            <h3>Prior Experience</h3>
            <p>
                I come from the experiential marketing industry where my primary role was graphic film installation.
                I helped build retail displays, exhibitions, and events for major athletic wear companies, tech giants, and sports teams.
                We translated design concepts into reality with the limited time and resources their environments afforded. In this industry,
                details and solutions are paramount. Installing in pre-existing enviroments means every project has its unique and
                unpredictable challenges to overcome. Working under strict deadlines with limited resources encouraged dynamic and collabrative productions.
                These experiences strengthed my ability to quickly diagnose and implement solutions in continuously shifting enviroments.
