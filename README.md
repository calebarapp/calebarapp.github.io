# calebarapp.com | My Portfolio
This is my portfolio site.
I tried to keep things as miniamlist as possible.
I focused on stark contrasts and empty space for the layout. In later updates I will be reworking the experience section to allow for proffessional history.  
### source files:  
I included the source files for the project, I compiled files from SRC to assets via Gulp.
