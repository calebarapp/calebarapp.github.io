# calebarapp.com | My Portfolio
This is my portfolio site v1.
I tried to keep things as miniamlist as possible.
I focused on stark contrasts and empty space for the layout.

### source files:  
I included the source files for the project, I compiled files from src to css via Sass. My SASS files are arranged with ITCSS, the bulk of the CSS being in the components.scss and objects.scss files.
